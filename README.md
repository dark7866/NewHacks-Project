# NewHacks-Project



Inspiration: Have you ever wanted to read any form of text, be that via audio or text, English or not, without the use of manual Google Translate? Well here's our solution!

What it does: Using various Google Cloud APIs, our all-in-one translation tool takes in any program file, be that a Word Document, PDF or even an image, of any language, convert this to text output, and provide you with the option of listening to, or just plain view the text in English.

How we built it: Using HTML for our webpage, python for all of the coding processes and Google Cloud APIs to make things a whole lot simpler, this webpage application was created.

Challenges we ran into: Upon arrival to this hack, we still had yet to finalize our theme, to which also, took about 1 maybe 2 hours into the hack. Aside from that, debugging code from time to time, one main challenge was deploying code onto Google's deployable web servers. To which we fixed by..............

Accomplishments that we're proud of: Overall, we're proud of the result that we were able to complete from scratch and present to others in the span of about 24 or so hours.

What we learned: How to utilize all the resources provided to use during our time at this hack, aside from the hardware and mobile development that we may see to implement soon.

What's next for myScanlations: Moving onto more platforms for ease of access, most likely mobile platforms, as well as better GUI and more programming language capabilities.
